## TODO

Still have a bunch of tiny tweaks and extras to build, but th

- clamp themes, saturation and lightness above 80, or below 20 just wont work

- add theme to parts, checkbox, radio button, range sliders ect...

- styles for `details` & `summary`

- ability for an accent color (defaults to theme)

- Tweak `code`, `pre`, `kbd`

- input highlight on focus

- documentation around `main` , `article`, `section` tags
